		<h2> Who am I? </h2>
		<p> I am a third year Computer Science and Engineering student at The Ohio State University. At OSU I was introduced to Linux, and have been transfixed ever since. I currently run Arch Linux on my two machines, and I am the President of the Open Source club at OSU. I enjoy the learning experience offerred not just in the classroom, but in clubs, hackathons, and from my peers as well. I am most happy with a terminal open, typing away on a project in Vim.

		<h3>GPA: 3.48</h3>
		<p> Over two years in Computer Science and Engineering at OSU I have taken a number of technical courses relating to the essentials of computer science. These include
		<ul>
			<li>Systems</li> <li>Foundations(and data structures)</li> <li>Software engineering</li> <li>Electrical Engineering</li> <li>and more</li>
		</ul>
		Despite the rigor of these courses, I have found a large amount of my learning to happen outside of the classroom in clubs(such as Opensource and Collegiate Web developer's group) and from my peers. </p>
