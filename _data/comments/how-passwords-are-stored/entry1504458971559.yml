message: "Awesome article Malide! Was just starting to look into proper password security for a website I am building, and you make hashing much simpler than most explanations I have read. One suggestion for you: \r\n\r\nAs obvious as it seems to you and me you might want to mention the way you verify a password against a stored hash is to hash the password and compare the hashes since hashing is one way."
